Next week Andr√© and I attend the Microsoft TechDays in Antwerp. We are especially interested in the pre-conference day. This is a hole day of SharePoint sessions! LINQ and SharePoint WCF webservices and SharePoint Workflow and SharePoint   

At the conference I will blog about the sessions. [![480x325ani](http://arnoldboersma.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/480x325ani.gif "480x325ani")](http://www.techdays.be)
